### Docker extended multistage phase 0 ###

Requirements:
  - Working Docker installation
  - A working Internet connection
  - Basic docker knowledge from earlier docker exercises

Goal:
  - Create optimized Dockerfile that optimizes Dockerfile-fatty Docker image size under 120MB

1. Compile Dockerfile-fatty to Docker image and test it (run it), check image size

2. Create copy of Dockerfile-fatty with name Dockerfile

3. Use second FROM ubuntu:16.04 to create image that has only the previously compiled myapp application

4. Build your image from this new Dockerfile as in step 1, test it and compare image sizes.
   It should have same functionality.

5. Continue to phase1

TIP: Use '-f Dockerfile-fatty' in building. Use also 'FROM blaa as builder' and
     'COPY --from=builder' statements in new Dockerfile.
